      PARAMETER(NN=400,NNZ=8,PINUM=3.1415926535898D0,FLOOR=1.D-33)
C  NN  is the maximum allowed number of mesh intervals;
C  NNZ is the maximum allowed number of target layers (shells);
C  NN and NNZ must be even numbers!
C  FLOOR is the minimum positive number: all numbers X
C        with ABS(X) < FLOOR are considered to be zeros.
